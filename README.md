I have made an ambulance job for you which makes sending a dispatch WITHOUT cell phone trigger. Perfect for the new phone: https://github.com/project-error/npwd

 You can simply accept or decline your emergency calls via the Notify system. 

For this you need the T-Notify-System: https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify

Also the bugging on the floor was fixed your medics get a 3D draw text where the person is lying. 

The job has a total of 10 ranks but the clothes and vehicles you have to design yourself because your EUPs and so on will be different from mine.


REQUIRED: (Or you exchange the Notify against yours)

T-Notify: https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify

OPTIONAL:

NPWD: https://github.com/project-error/npwd



This job is only in the cooperation with me : https://github.com/waschmaschvanlu created so let him also a star there.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them under issues.
